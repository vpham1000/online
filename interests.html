                Since I was 16 years old, I’ve loved using photography as a way to turn everyday moments into memories, 
                and memories into beautiful representations of real life. I’ve been lucky enough to visit and get to 
                know some amazing places and people throughout my life, and photography is one way in which I 
                try to preserve these experiences. Photography connects me to my environment, my friends, and - more than 
                anything - myself.

                Not only do I love trying new food, but I also love experimenting with recipes in my free time. Making something new is exciting - especially if it is from scratch! My experiences with food in the United States, as well as taking cooking classes in Spain, Italy, and Portugal, have given me insight in understanding different cultures and people.

                At Syracuse, I had a show once a week on WERW, a student-run radio station. It allowwed me to take a break from my school work 
                and gave me an opportunity to incorporate music into my life. I was also on the music staff of the organization which allowed me to work 
                with a team to curate playlist concepts for the station and research independent musicians to showcase.

                Whatever it is, I am up for the challenge. I love going outside my comfort zone and trying things 
                I’ve never done before. Growing up as an only child forced me to come up with creative 
                ways to entertain myself and that’s something I have carried with me throughout my life. 
                I am always exploring my interests, trying a new hobby, and learning new things.
