            I am a recent graduate from Syracuse University with a degree in Information Management and Technology
            and a concentration in web design. My curiosity has led me down different avenues of creativity and I never want to stop 
            exploring or learning. I face challenges with an open mind and can easily adapt to the current situation. 
            My passions intersect at the center of technology, design, and psychology. Let's connect!
