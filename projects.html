                <p>Hopper is a travel booking app that allows users to find the best deals on flights, hotels, and car rentals. 
                My project was to re-design this app through my own vision and turn it into my ideal travel app. 
                The main incentive of traveling is seeing beautiful places so I wanted my design to showcase clear and 
                visual pictures to capture users’ attention front and foremost. I also designed the booking process to flow seamlessly 
                through an intuitive series of steps. I created the wireframe on Adobe xD by putting blocks as placeholders for where
                I wanted photos and texts. When I had all my photos and texts prepared,
                I just inserted them into the blocks which made for a smooth prototyping experience. </p>

                    The original website is outdated and does not fully capture the atmosphere of the MOST museum. 
                    I wanted to encompass the brand of the museum while emphasizing the events and exhibits that they offered. </p>

                        geometric shapes, big pictures, and playful colors that would match the MOST brand. I wanted the front page to 
                        be kid-friendly while also displaying the most important information for parents to view.

                <p> In this project, my group members and I worked with the Syracuse Urban Food Forest Project (SUFFP) to 
                come up with ideas on how to spread information about urban foraging throughout the Syracuse community. 
                After a few brainstorming meetings, we came up with an accessible guidebook that contains information on 
                urban foraging and the many different plants that can be found in our local food forests in the Upstate 
                and Central New York area. SUFFP plans to distribute this guidebook at parks, libraries, and community centers. 
                My group members and I all had different roles for the creation of this booklet and mine was the design and 
                layout of it. </p>

                    For my final project in my Information Visualization class, I was required to make a poster displaying 
                    a story with data from a dataset with over 20,000 entries. I chose the topic “Mental Health in the Tech Industry”
                    because it  intrigued me as an upcoming graduate about to enter the workforce. As someone who has struggled 
                    with mental health, I connected with this project personally. I found the dataset on http://osmihelp.org 
                    (Open Sourcing Mental Illness). I coded the graphs with R language in RStudio and put the poster 
                    together in Adobe Illustrator.

                <p>Glossier is a makeup company that first started selling their products solely online. They have generated 
                a massive cult following through their genius marketing initiatives and social media presence.  
                The company has one brick-and-mortar store and a few pop-up shops, but most of their sales are 
                through their website. For my project, I have created an E-Commerce sales database that will 
                keep track of customers, shipping information, products, orders, etc. I created a logical model 
                of the database and brought it to life with SQL language in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
